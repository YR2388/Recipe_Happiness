Governments in all different countries tried to quantified happiness to help them improve their residents’ overall satisfaction. World happiness provides essential factors for quantifying happiness. These are freedom, social support, GDP per capita, percentage of corruption, generosity, and healthy life expectancy. We will discuss the meaning of all these six factors in the data chapter. Therefore, in our project, we provide an analysis to show different recipes to gain happiness. That is: what are the recipes of happiness? Specifically, we will first study the success of the countries that have the highest happiness score. Next, we will focus on those outlier countries, especially Latin America. Among all the developing countries, why the countries in Latin America have relatively higher happiness scores? Then we will bring our sight to those countries that have huge improvements in their happiness scores from 2016 to 2019. Our team members are Yiwei Ren, Jing Lu and Xiaowei Zhang. Jing Lu was responsible for the Missing data and the first section of our topic: What are some most important features of happiness? Yiwei Ren was responsible for the data preprocessing and also the second section of our topic: what is the success of Latin America? Jing Lu was responsible for our conclusions and the last section of our topic: what is the secret of countries with huge improvement? "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources The World happiness data was generated by Gallup World Poll and it is accessible through the website of World Happiness report. The world happiness report is the publication of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network(SDSN). SDSN was launched by United Nations to support sustainable development. It can be download directly from the world happiness report website. We collected the happiness record from 2016 to 2019. There are 11 features in each dataframe. They are Country,Happiness score, Whisker-high, Whisker-low, GDP per capita, Social support, Healthy life expectancy, Freedom to make life choices, Generosity,Perceptions of corruption, Dystopia (2.33) + residual. Happiness score is a ladder score from 0 to 10. Higher score indicate a happier life. Health life expectancy indicates the expected life time from birth of residents in each country. Freedom to make life choices indicate people’s level of freedom in choosing what to do with their life. Social support indicates whether there are relatives or friends ready to help you when you get into trouble. Generosity shows the willingness of donate their money to charities. The perceptions of corruption shows whether the residents believe there are perception issues in their governments. One of the issue of the data is that number of countries are not the same in between 2016 and 2019. This issue is caused by the fact that there is new country established every year. Another issue is also the standardized issue. The names of the six factors are different in each dataframe. In order to be able to combine them into one dataframe, we need to standardized their name. These preprocessing code will be published in the cleaning chapter.
